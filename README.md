## Project Overview 
PetBook is an application for pets and pet owners to connect and find friends relative to their location, helping pets find companions to play and socialize with, while helping pet owners meet other pet owners and pets. Owners can search for nearby pet-friendly locations such as parks, common walking routes, and pet play areas. Likewise, one can search for similar species, breeds, size of pet, beloved activities, favorite treats, and other specifications to find the perfect pet companion. Furthermore, nearby pets can be displayed sorted as the best match, weighted appropriately by species, location, and activities.

The stakeholders of our project will be both pets and pet owners.  Owners will be able to arrange meetup appointments with other pet owners in public places to allow their pets to interact and get their much-needed exercise.  PetBook gives owners the ability to meet owners who share a common love for the same species of pet, or even one completely different if they so choose.
